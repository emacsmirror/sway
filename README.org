#+TITLE: Sway ‚ù§ Emacs

This package provides a partial interface for integrating Sway with
Emacs.  It is meant for those Emacs users who prefer to let their
window manager deal with window management, and is designed to play
well with Shackle.



This requires an Emacs with (preferably native) JSON parsing.  Your
Emacs is built with native JSON iff =C-h f= reports that the function
=json-parse-buffer= is implemented in C.
