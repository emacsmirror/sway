#+TITLE: Sway ‚ù§ Emacs

This package provides a partial interface for integrating Sway with
Emacs.  It is meant for those Emacs users who prefer to let their
window manager deal with window management, and is designed to play
well with [[https://depp.brause.cc/shackle/][Shackle]].

Its only directly usable feature right now is the
sway-shackle-display-buffer-frame, which eithers creates a new frame
with a given buffer or focus that buffer in the frame it's already
displayed on.  A reasonable default config with Shackle could look like:

#+begin_src elisp
  (setq shackle-default-rule '(:frame t)
        shackle-display-buffer-frame-function 'sway-shackle-display-buffer-frame)
#+end_src

This package requires an Emacs with (preferably native) JSON support.
Your Emacs is built with native JSON iff =C-h f= reports that the
function =json-parse-buffer= is implemented in C.
