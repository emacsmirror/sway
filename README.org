#+TITLE: Sway ‚ù§ Emacs

This package provides an partial interface for integrating sway from
within Emacs.  It is meant for those Emacs users who prefer to let
their window manager deal with window management, and is designed to
play well with Shackle.

This requires an Emacs with (preferably native) JSON parsing.  Your
Emacs is built with native JSON iff =C-h f= reports that the function
=json-parse-buffer= is implemented in C.
