;;; Commentary:

;; This is a very rudimentary library to talk to Sway from Emacs.  Its
;; main use case is in combination with Shackle or some other popup
;; managers, to 1) use frames instead of windows while still 2) giving
;; focus to existing frames instead of duplicating them.

;;; Code:

  window.")

  ;; but could maybe be improved.
